Anaylsis:
The purpose of this project is to help Pyber ride sharing data improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.  For us to have  an understanding of who is riding  and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates we  create visualizations of rideshare data to determine what actions need to be taken.
Findings:
By reviewing the summary we can see that there  are significant advantages for Pyber in Urban cites. For Pyber, urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural areas have the least. Urban cities have significantly more drivers than suburban cities. Suburban cities  have vastly greater revenue than rural citiees..  Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver. When there is more drivers to riders the fair is higher and revenue is greater. Surbanan cities clearly generate more revenue..
Summary:
Some recommendations to Pyber can be to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to generate more revenue..  Continue the growing rural cities because this shows the  average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher than suburban, .Rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. Try to mitigate risk when there are potential peak hours. Increase drivers during that time. Another examinations we should look at is during the holiday season to see if there is any trend differences we see like Thansgiving and Christmas.
